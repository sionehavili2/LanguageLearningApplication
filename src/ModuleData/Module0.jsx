A common glottal stop used by English speakrs is 'nuh uh' or 'uh uh' which is used when expressing disagreement or disapproval. the abrupt (sharp) sound in between is a glottal stop. it may sound as if you were sounding out a letter than came a brief stop. The glottal stop is used very often within the Tongan language and should be practiced throughout your learning experience. Early mastery of the glottal stops will ensure proper pronunciation and ensure learners do not mispronounce or say something with a completely different meaning.",
