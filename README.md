Project Introduction

This document serves to develop and design a Tongan Language Learning application.
This responds to the need for an accessible and engaging platform to individuals learning
the Tongan language. The application aims to provide essential learning resources in an
accessible format. Learning modules with features such as basic alphabet and number
exercises, practical vocabulary, language translation and interactive quizzes provide
multiple avenues to learn, study and practice. Learning modules will closely follow the
structure from lessons in the book “Intensive Course in Tongan” (Shumway, 2005). All
server front-end and back-end communication will be facilitated through Google’s Firebase
to store and track user progression and secure user data. The application will be a
user-friendly tool that facilitates language resources in an educational format.
